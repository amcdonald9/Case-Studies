### Compliance & Operations Case Studies
I solve problems most people don't see yet. This portfolio shows three investigations where I found patterns, documented evidence, and drove real change. These are actual cases from my career in quality assurance, compliance, and operations.
What's Here
I've documented three major investigations across different industries. Same skill set, different problems.
The Numbers:

3 major investigations completed
220+ agents monitored and evaluated
1,600+ call reviews conducted
2 organization wide policy changes
$40,000+ in revenue protected

### The Cases
Case 1: The Broken Handoff (2024)
What happened: A virtual learning company was losing families because their enrollment process was broken. Documents sat for days, families got harassed with calls, and nobody was connecting the dots.
What I did: I tracked 100+ families, documented that 50 to 60% of documents had errors, and proved families were getting 8 to 10 calls per week from different departments with zero coordination.
The result: Leadership implemented a 3 call per week maximum within 24 hours. I also cut enrollment delays by 3+ days by proactively reviewing documents instead of waiting for families to call us.
Skills used: Compliance review, FERPA, policy change, data analysis, process optimization

Case 2: The Metric Manipulation Ring (2023)
What happened: At a home security company, sales numbers looked good but something felt off. Agents were hitting targets but customers were complaining about pricing.
What I did: Over six months, I reviewed 1,500+ calls across 120 agents. I discovered 50% of the sales team (30 out of 60 agents) were using unauthorized discounts. There was a whole coaching network where senior agents taught new hires how to game the system. I even found someone working under another agent's login for over 2 months.
The result: 6 agents terminated, 30 retrained, monitoring protocols doubled. I got promoted from entry level to Operations Support in 3 months. Protected an estimated $40,000+ in annual revenue.
Skills used: Quality assurance, fraud detection, revenue protection, remote monitoring, operations

Case 3: The Phantom Inventory (2013)
What happened: Early in my career at a restaurant, I noticed inventory numbers didn't match what we actually had. Food costs were through the roof but nobody could explain why.
What I did: I volunteered to help with inventory (not my job) and spent three months tracking patterns. Losses always happened during the same shifts. Turned out a shift supervisor was scheduling themselves alone during closing and stealing $800 to $1,000 worth of product every week.
The result: Supervisor was terminated, I got promoted to Shift Lead then Team Lead, and the company saved $3,000 to $4,000 monthly. This was my first real investigation and it taught me I'm good at seeing patterns others miss.
Skills used: Loss prevention, pattern recognition, inventory control, revenue protection

bashpython -m http.server 8000

Then go to http://localhost:8000
That's it. No npm install, no dependencies, nothing complicated.

### What These Cases Show

Investigation Skills:

I spot patterns in large data sets
I document everything systematically
I find root causes, not just symptoms
I use data to back up my findings

Compliance & QA:

FERPA compliance monitoring
Policy violation detection
Quality frameworks
Regulatory stuff

Process Improvement:

I make workflows more efficient
I identify bottlenecks before they become crises
I work across departments to fix problems
I explain complex issues in plain language

Revenue Protection:

Fraud detection and prevention
Loss prevention strategies
Risk assessment
I can calculate the financial impact

### My Investigation Process
Every case I work follows the same basic approach:

Notice something's off (trust your gut)
Document systematically (create tracking systems)
Look for patterns (one incident is an error, ten is a system problem)
Gather evidence (be thorough, be fair)
Calculate impact (numbers matter)
Present solutions (don't just point out problems)
Follow through (track if changes actually work)

### Important Note
These case studies are real. I actually did these investigations. But I've changed company names and some details to protect proprietary information and respect confidentiality agreements.
The methodologies, data patterns, investigation processes, and results are all genuine. I can discuss any of these in detail during interviews.
